# Dex
This is a fully tested basic dex. The frontend to interact with the dex can be run using `yarn run dev` in the ***dex_frontend*** folder. 
The backend is to be started on the ***dex_backend*** folder by running `yarn hardhat node` to deploy a local blockchain and interact with the contract.
The frontend makes use of **Moralis** to interact and send contract calls.

You can call functions like **deposit(), withdraw()** and even convert ** eth to balloon token** and vice versa.
